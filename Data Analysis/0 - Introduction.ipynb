    "Data analysis is a process of `inspecting`, `cleansing`, `transforming and modeling data` with the goal of `discovering useful information`, `informing conclusions and supporting decision-making`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* First part of data analysis is gathering data data, cleaning the data to remove all the garbage data and transforming the data to the form that we can use.\n",
    "* Modelling data is the process applying real world scenarios to the data models that we create. This is done using statistical tools\n",
    "* Discovering useful information means that from all the data that we have gathered and processed, we want to derive information\n",
    "* Informing conclusions and support decision making is the final step of data analysis. Once we have derived useful information from the data , we want to use that * information to make better informed decisions and come to an informed conclusion."
