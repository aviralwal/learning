The goal of analysis is to identify trends and relationships within the data so that you can accurately answer the question you're asking. To do this, you should stick to the 4 phases of analysis: \n",

JOINs help you combine matching or related columns from different tables. An inner JOIN is a function that returns records with matching values in both tables. When we input JOIN into SQL, it usually defaults to inner JOIN. A LEFT JOIN is a function that will return all the records from the left table and only the matching records from the right table. RIGHT JOIN does the opposite. It will return all records from the right table and only the matching records from the left.  OUTER join combines RIGHT and LEFT JOIN to return all matching records in both tables. This means it will return all records in both tables. \n",

    "* A `subquery` is a SQL query that is nested inside of a larger query. With subqueries you can combine different pieces of logic together. Because the logic of your outer query relies on the inner query, you can get more done with a single query. The innermost query executes first.\n",
    "* `HAVING` basically allows you to add a filter to your query instead of the underlying table when you're working with aggregate functions.\n",
    "* `CASE` returns records with your conditions by allowing you to include if/then statements in your query."
