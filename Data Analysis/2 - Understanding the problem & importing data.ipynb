    "For eg, we have a problem in which we have a car to sell for which we have to determine what is the best selling price for is, i.e., price that is neither too low nor too high. For this, the questions we can ask are whether there is any existing dataset for used car prices that we can use for our analysis? Also what features of the car affect the prices, like color, brand, horsepower, etc? To solve this problem we will use a [used car prices dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/) located at `data/imports-85-data.csv` and the dataset description file is located at `data/imports-85-names.csv`."

    "\n",
    "The dataset being used is an open, publically available dataset in csv format. The dataset itself does not contain the headers. We can look at the documentation file `imports-85-names.md` to get infromation about the headers, like their name and the range of values. For eg, `symboling` represents insurance risk value(+3 is most risky and -3 is least risky). Higher the risk level, higher is the insurance cost. `normalized-losses` meansis the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc), and represents the average loss per car per year. `price` is the attribute which is our target value or label, i.e., the value that we want to predict. Other variables will be used for labelling (predicting) the value."
