    "### Types of data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple types of data analysis that is used by data scientist to answer questions. There are broadly 6 categories of difficulties. In increasing order of difficulty, they are -\n",
    "1. **Descriptive** - \n",
    "![descriptive analysis](images/data_science-data_analysis-descriptive.png)\n",
    "This is usually the first analysis in the new dataset. In this, we just create a basic summary of the complete data that we have and do not try to find conclusions.There are additionaly analysis required if we want to create any interpretation.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory** - \n",
    "![exploratory analysis](images/data_science-data_analysis-exploratory.png)\n",
    "In this, we explore the relation between different variables in the data that weren't previously visible but do not confirm the causation of the relation, i.e., it does not tell how the change in 1 affects the another. This analysis should not be used as a final say on how and why the data is related to each other\n",
    "3. **Inferential** - \n",
    "![inferential analysis](images/data_science-data_analysis-inferential.png)\n",
    "Inferential analysis is commonly the goal of statistical modelling. Where you have a small amount of information to extrapolate and generalise that information to a larger group. If the data you collect is not from a representative sample of the population, the generalizations you infer won't be accurate for the population.\n",
    "4. **Predictive**\n",
    "![predictive analysis](images/data_science-data_analysis-predictive.png)\n",
    "5. **Causal** - \n",
    "![causal analysis](images/data_science-data_analysis-causal.png)\n",
    "Generally, causal analysis are fairly complicated to do with observed data alone. There will always be questions as to whether are these correlation driving your conclusions, or that the assumptions underlying your analysis are valid. It is seen frequently in scientific studies where scientists are trying to identify the cause of a phenomenon. But often getting appropriate data for doing a causal analysis is a challenge\n",
    "6. **Mechanistic** - \n",
    "![mechanistic analysis](images/data_science-data_analysis-mechanistic.png)\n",
    "Mechanistic analysis are not nearly as commonly used as the previous analysis."

    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, we need to design a proper experiement to answer the questions. Experimental design is organizing an experiment so that you have the correct data (and enough of it!) to clearly and effectively answer your data science question. Before going into analysis, it is imp to have a plan on how we will proceed with the analysis of data since incorrect analysis can lead to incorrect answers for our questions. "
