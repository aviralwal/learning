# TODO - 
1. Add info on how to [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) JSON, XML, [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) and API data in python in `Learning/Data analysis/Reading data.ipynb`
2. Read about [datatable](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) in python(It will most probably go in data analysis part)
3. Understanding quartiles in data.

# Interesting things to study - 
1. [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) - Data pipeline and workflow management
2. [Apache Superset](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/) - Data Visualization tool
3. [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) - unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
